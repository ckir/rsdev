//! # NASDAQ Data Feeds Module (Placeholder)
//!
//! This module is intended to house specialized clients and data models for
//! interacting with various NASDAQ data feeds, beyond just basic market status.
//!
//! ## Purpose:
//! In future development, this module will contain the logic to subscribe to
//! and process real-time market data streams (e.g., Level 1, Level 2 quotes,
//! trade data) or to fetch historical data from NASDAQ-specific endpoints.
//! This ensures a clean separation of concerns for different aspects of NASDAQ
//! data integration.
//!
//! Currently, this module serves as a placeholder.

// This module may contain datafeed-specific logic in the future.
